# Data Science Internship Projects

Welcome to the repository for my data science internship projects completed with Seven7Code Technologies. This repository includes the following tasks:

# Project Overview

This project is a compilation of tasks completed as part of the Data Science internship at Seven7Code Technologies. The internship focused on applying machine learning and data analysis techniques to real-world datasets. Each task involved creating predictive models and performing data analysis to derive actionable insights.

## Table of Contents

1. Cricket player performance
2. Titanic data

## Titanic Classification

### Overview
This project involves creating a system to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic would have survived the sinking. The model considers various factors such as socio-economic status, age, and gender to make predictions.


### Key Features
- Socio-economic status
- Age
- Gender
- Cabin class
- Embarked port

### Approach
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Feature Engineering
3. Model Building
4. Evaluation


### Code
You can find the code for this project in the `titanic_classification` directory.

## Cricket player performance

### Overview
This project involves predicting cricket player performance during the Cricket World Cup 2019 using machine learning techniques.


### Key Features
- Player statistics
- Match conditions
- Historical performance

### Approach
1. Data Cleaning
2. Feature Selection
3. Model Training
4. Performance Evaluation


### Code
You can find the code for this project in the `cricket_performance_prediction` directory.

## How to Run the Code

1. Clone this repository using `git clone <repository-link>`.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run the notebook or script as described in the respective directories.
